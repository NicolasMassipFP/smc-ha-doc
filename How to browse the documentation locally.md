**My personal recommendation is to:**

- Clone the repository using 
	``git clone https://github.com/NicolasMassipFP/smc-ha-doc.git`` 
	
or download the appropriate release from  
    https://github.com/NicolasMassipFP/smc-ha-doc/releases 

> **Clone the repository** allows you to easily update the documentation using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). The main branch always tracks the latest SMC version and includes notes about changes from previous versions. The **Troubleshooting** section is most accurate in the latest version.

> **Releases** are tied to a specific SMC version and are **not updated**.

- Install  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/ )

- Open the cloned repository folder as an Obsidian vault

This documentation was written in Obsidian, but it uses **standard Markdown links** instead of Obsidian‑specific links to ensure it can be browsed with any Markdown‑compatible tool.
