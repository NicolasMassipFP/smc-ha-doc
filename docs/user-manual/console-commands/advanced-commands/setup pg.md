[back to all console commands](../../command-line-administration.md)

Setting up PostgreSQL replication is handled automatically by the SMC installer.  
This command is normally **not** required for regular administration, as it is used internally during installation.

You may need to run it **only if instructed by Support**.

The command registers the SMC replication configuration in the PostgreSQL system tables.
