[back to all administration commands](../../gui-administration-admin-commands.md)

> This command is available from the _Database Replication_ submenu in the contextual menu of a Management Server within the [HA Administration window](../../gui-administration-admin-window.md) when an applicable unstable state is detected. 

**Declares the server as Standby without modifying the replication configuration.**  
Standby mode prevents any user operation on the system and allows the administrator to decide the safest way to proceed.

This menu appears, for example, when multiple Active Management Servers are detected. It may also appear in broken replication states, depending on the condition of all servers.
