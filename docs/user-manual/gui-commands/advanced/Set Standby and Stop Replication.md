[back to all administration commands](../../gui-administration-admin-commands.md)

> This command is available from the _Database Replication_ submenu in the contextual menu of a Management Server within the [HA Administration window](../../gui-administration-admin-window.md) when an applicable unstable state is detected. 

**Stops replication and switches the server to Standby mode.**  
Use this for an urgent shutdown of replication to prevent any user modification until the appropriate resolution has been identified.

This menu appears on the Active Server when it is in a broken state, depending on the condition of the other servers, or when more than one Active Server is detected.
