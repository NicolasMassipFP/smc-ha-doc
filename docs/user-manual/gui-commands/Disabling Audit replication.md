> This command is available from the _Audit Replication_ submenu in the contextual menu of an **Active** Management Server within the [HA Administration window](../gui-administration-admin-window.md).

Refer to the  [HA Administration](../gui-administration.md) section for a high‑level overview of audit replication and its role within HA Management and the reasons why audit replication may be disabled.

Enabling or disabling audit replication can be performed **only on the Active Management Server, and the change requires a Management Server restart** to take effect.
