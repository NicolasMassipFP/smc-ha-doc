ORPHANED MARKDOWN FILES ANALYSIS REPORT
========================================

Project: smc-ha-doc
Analysis Date: 2024
Script: find_orphans.py

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

Total Markdown Files Scanned: 61
Referenced Files: 58
Orphaned Files: 3
Coverage: 95.1% of files are referenced

METHODOLOGY
===========

1. Scanned all markdown files (*.md) in the project recursively
2. Extracted all markdown links [text](url) from each file
3. Properly decoded URL-encoded characters (e.g., %20 → space)
4. Resolved relative paths from each markdown file's location
5. Identified files not referenced by any other markdown file
6. Generated ORPHAN.md with detailed list

KEY FEATURES
============

✓ URL Decoding: Properly handles encoded characters in links
✓ Relative Path Resolution: Resolves paths relative to source file
✓ Case-Sensitive Matching: Exact filename matching
✓ External Link Filtering: Ignores http://, https://, ftp:// URLs
✓ Self-Reference Detection: Files referencing themselves still count as orphaned

ORPHANED FILES DETAILS
======================

1. README.md
   Location: Root directory
   Type: Entry Point Document
   Reason: Main documentation entry point, accessed directly
   Status: EXPECTED - This is the primary entry document
   Action: No action needed

2. CHANGELOG.md
   Location: Root directory
   Type: Standalone Document
   Reason: Project changelog, typically referenced externally
   Status: EXPECTED - Standard repository document
   Action: No action needed

3. .internal/TAGS.md
   Location: .internal/ directory
   Type: Internal Metadata
   Reason: Internal documentation/metadata file
   Status: EXPECTED - Internal use only
   Action: No action needed

VERIFICATION EXAMPLES
=====================

Referenced Files (Examples):
- "How to browse the documentation locally.md"
  ✓ Referenced by: README.md (with URL encoding: How%20to%20browse%20...)

- "installation.md"
  ✓ Referenced by: README.md, upgrade.md, reset server setup.md

- "gui-administration-admin-commands.md"
  ✓ Referenced by: Multiple GUI command files

Properly Handled URL Encoding:
- Link: "How%20to%20browse%20the%20documentation%20locally.md"
  Decoded to: "How to browse the documentation locally.md"
  Status: ✓ File found and marked as referenced

FINDINGS
========

All Orphaned Files Are Expected:
- README.md: Main entry point (intentionally orphaned)
- CHANGELOG.md: Standard repository file (intentionally orphaned)
- .internal/TAGS.md: Internal metadata (intentionally orphaned)

No Action Required:
All orphaned files serve legitimate purposes as entry points or
standalone documents that are typically accessed through repository
interfaces rather than internal documentation links.

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. README.md
   - Keep as orphaned (main entry point)
   - Consider adding navigation links from other docs if needed

2. CHANGELOG.md
   - Keep as orphaned (accessed via repository)
   - Could be linked from README.md if version history is important

3. .internal/TAGS.md
   - Keep as orphaned (internal use)
   - No action needed

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

Script Implementation:
- Language: Python 3
- Dependencies: Standard library only (pathlib, re, urllib.parse)
- Input: All *.md files in project tree
- Output: ORPHAN.md file at project root

Link Detection Pattern:
- Regex: \[([^\]]*)\]\(([^)]+)\)
- Matches: [text](url) format
- Excludes: External URLs (http://, https://, ftp://)
- Handles: URL-encoded characters, anchors (#fragments)

Path Resolution:
- Base: Each markdown file's directory
- Method: Relative path resolution
- Validation: Case-sensitive file existence check

CONCLUSION
==========

The orphan detection analysis completed successfully. All 3 orphaned
files are intentionally standalone documents that serve as entry points
or repository metadata. No documentation structure issues were found.

The remaining 58 markdown files are properly interlinked, creating a
well-connected documentation structure with 95.1% internal connectivity.
