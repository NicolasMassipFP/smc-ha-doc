SMC legacy replication was replaced by native PostgreSQL replication in SMC version ``7.3.0``. This documentation applies only to SMC installations that use native PostgreSQL replication. 

Versions ``7.3.0``,`` 7.3.1``, and ``7.4.0`` have known issues affecting Management Client behavior connected on the **Standby Server** (this does not affect replication).
